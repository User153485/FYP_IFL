FYP_IFL
=======
This repository contains all the server side logic required to run the IFL's contest site. Each time you begin coding, it is prudent that you pull all updates to your local repository first. As the entire team is sharing the same code base, DO NOT synchronize personal files and settings for applications to this code repository - that is, set your Git application to IGNORE certain files and folders (e.g. nbproject in your local repository) that contains these personalized settings. In the event that you are not sure whether your new code breaks the existing ones, it is highly recommended that you commit your work to a development branch, instead of the master branch. The rest of the team can then vet and merge the branches if there are no issues caused by your code.
